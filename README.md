## Installation
Want to run Crappit? Follow these steps:
1. Open up your terminal and install node.js. You can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
2. In your terminal, cd into a directory you want to clone Crappit.
3. Follow the commands below:
```
git clone https://github.com/trangj/Crappit.git
cd Crappit-React
npm i
cd client
npm i
cd ..
```
4. You need to set up a file that contains, your mongodb uri, AWS id and key and a secret for jwt. To do this, create a directory named 'config' in the main directory and then create a file named keys.js inside there. The format of this file should be similar to this:
```
module.exports = {
  mongoURI:"<your mongo uri>",
  jwtSecret: "<your secret>",
  aws: {
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: "<your aws access id>",
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: "<your aws access key>"
  },
  sendgrid: "<your sendgrid api key>"
};

```
5. To run the server, enter the command:
```
npm run dev
```
6. Have fun!
